# **Integrated Environmental Monitoring System**

## **Overview**
This project implements a real-time **Environmental Monitoring System** using the C programming language. 
It interacts with a free API to retrieve live environmental data such as temperature and humidity. 
The system processes this data, stores it, and generates real-time alerts for critical readings.

## **Features**
- **API Integration**: Fetches live environmental data (e.g., temperature, humidity) using an API.
- **Data Management**: Stores raw and processed data in files.
- **Automation**: Includes shell scripts to automate data retrieval and processing.
- **Memory Optimization**: Utilizes pointers and dynamic memory allocation for efficient data handling.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Implements Linux system calls for alerting personnel of critical conditions.
- **Modular Design**: Organized using header files for better code readability and maintenance.
